## Overview
Accurate biomass resource mapping is a foundational requirement for sustainable energy planning, directly
influencing feedstock availability assessment, supply chain design, infrastructure siting, and long-term
renewable energy policy. Traditional biomass estimation approaches—largely dependent on field surveys
and linear statistical models—struggle to scale across large, heterogeneous landscapes and fail to capture
nonlinear relationships present in environmental systems.

This paper provides a **systematic and technically grounded review of machine learning approaches for
biomass resource mapping**, focusing on how data-driven models leverage **multi-source geospatial data**
to improve spatial accuracy, scalability, and decision relevance. The study synthesizes findings from
recent literature where **satellite imagery (optical, SAR, LiDAR), GIS-based spatial layers, and ground
inventory data** are integrated with modern ML techniques to estimate aboveground biomass across
agricultural, forest, and urban systems.

Beyond estimation accuracy, the paper emphasizes how ML-enabled biomass maps support **practical
energy planning objectives**, including logistics optimization, bioenergy plant site selection, seasonal
energy forecasting, and sustainability assessment. Particular attention is given to challenges such as
data scarcity, sensor limitations, spatial heterogeneity, and uncertainty—highlighting why ensemble,
deep learning, and hybrid ML frameworks increasingly outperform traditional methods in real-world
applications.

## Technical Scope and Contributions
This work analyzes and compares a wide range of machine learning paradigms used in biomass estimation,
with emphasis on their suitability for large-scale, policy-relevant energy planning:

- **Regression and kernel-based models** for baseline biomass prediction and interpretability
- **Tree-based ensemble methods** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) for handling nonlinear,
  high-dimensional geospatial data
- **Deep learning architectures** (CNNs, RNNs, LSTM/GRU) for spatial and temporal biomass modeling
- **Hybrid and ensemble frameworks** combining ML with GIS layers and biophysical constraints to
  improve robustness and generalization
- **Multi-sensor data fusion** integrating optical imagery, SAR, LiDAR, and field inventories to reduce
  saturation effects and prediction bias
- **Emerging directions** including transfer learning, uncertainty-aware modeling, and digital twin
  concepts for data-sparse regions

The paper further connects these techniques to downstream applications such as **biomass supply chain
optimization, renewable energy system design, grid integration, and long-term resource sustainability
assessment**, positioning machine learning as a critical enabler of scalable and evidence-based energy
planning.
